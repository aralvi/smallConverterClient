              A digital marker is created by a website visitor&apos;s Internet
              browser to maintain certain pieces of information for the website
              to reference during the same or subsequent visits. Examples of
              digital markers are cookies or HTML5 Web storage. Among other
              things, digital markers can allow a website to recognize a
              previous visit each time the visitor accesses the website, and
              track what information is viewed on a website.
              <br />
              <br />
              We use sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions
              of our websites. Digital markers are created when you visit our
              websites. Sessional markers exist while you remain on our
              websites, and persistent markers continue to exist after you have
              left our websites.
              <br />
              <br /> For information on the digital markers (including cookies)
              we use and the purposes for which we use them see the applicable
              Cookie Notice for the PDFTron website(s) you may visit.

              Similarly, we or our third-party service providers/advertisers may

              tracking technologies, which are typically small pieces of code

              These digital markers and other technologies may be used to track

              can be used to analyze your online traffic patterns, to enhance
              your experience when using our products, to store information
              during your session, to personalize our websites for you based on
